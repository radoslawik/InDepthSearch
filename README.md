## üìñ About
InDepthSearch is a multi-platform desktop search engine to find the keywords inside the documents content, in both text and images. Currently supported platforms:
 - Windows 10 (x86 and x64)
 - Linux (x64)
 - macOS (x64)

**NOTE:** Currently the project is in pre-release state, some functionalities are not implemented yet and some of them work only on a specific platform.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Features
The table below lists the features and their compatibility with the supported platforms:

| Name  | Windows | Linux  | macOS |

<sup>**</sup>  Only PDF format is supported at the moment, but in the future it is planned to extend it to DOC, DOCX and ODT.
